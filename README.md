The objective of this project is determining the efficacy of Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab in other cancers beyond their common uses. A preliminary step for this will be determining the expression levels of the target genes (HER2 and VEGF) within these cancer cells lines, based on their scRNA-seq data. Cancer cell lines serve as a robust model system to determine the efficacy of anti cancer drugs by providing a homogenous, regulated cell population for testing and analysis. 

Trastuzumab
Targets HER2 
used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.

Bevacizumab: 
Targets VEGF 
used for a variety of cancers (ie: colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.)
