**The KSQ**
The objective of this project is determining the efficacy of Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab in other cancers beyond their common uses. A preliminary step for this will be determining the expression levels of the target genes (HER2 and VEGF) within these cancer cells lines, based on their scRNA-seq data. Cancer cell lines serve as a robust model system to determine the efficacy of anti cancer drugs by providing a homogenous, regulated cell population for testing and analysis. 

**What is scRNA, and why use it?**
As noted in Haque et. al (2017), scRNA "permits comparison of the transcriptomes of individual cells." In this case, the "transcriptome" is the specific analysis of how DNA is _expressed_ as proteins and other molecules by quantifying all of the mRNA (aka the genetic sequence of a gene). Therefore, it can be used on an individual cell level to determine expression levels of our target genes 

**Why use Cancer Cell Lines?**
Cancer cell lines are lines of cells that when taken care of under the correct controls, are not only immortal, but can retain many of the characteristics of the original cancer that they came from. Paired with -omics analysis or in our case, scRNA-seq data, the "driver mutations" can be more easily determined, and these results can be replicated due to the nature of the cancer cell line. Despite this importance, there are challenges with forming, maintaining, and utilizing cancer cell lines. From a technical perspective, growing cancer cell lines has a variety of challenges including isolating the cells and cell culture. Biologically, they can undergo genetic drift which makes the cell line less stable and/or useful, and there is a lack of influence from cell signaling molecules, which do have a role in cancer metastasis.

FINISH!
**Mechanism of Action — Trastuzumab**
Trastuzumab is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. HER2 
**Mechanism of Action — Bevacizumab**
Bevacizumab is used for a variety of cancers (ie: colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.) and targets VEGF.
