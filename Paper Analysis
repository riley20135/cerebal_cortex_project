How did the authors handle the potential caveat of co-culturing cell lines before profiling by scRNA-seq? Why do you think that caveat was or was not adequately addressed?

  The authors conducted control experiments comparing gene expression in cell lines with and without co-culturing, finding that co-culturing had a modest effect on average gene expression but did not significantly alter patterns of heterogeneity within cell lines. This suggests that the caveat was adequately addressed, as the core findings remained consistent across conditions.

The authors identified discrete subpopulations of cells within a subset of individual cell lines (Fig. 2A-B). What might be the reason why some cell lines have these discrete subpopulations while others do not?

  The presence of discrete subpopulations in some cell lines may be due to inherent genetic or epigenetic variability, differences in microenvironmental influences, or specific adaptations to culture conditions, which may not be uniformly present across all cell lines.

What are Recurrent Heterogeneous Programs (RHPs) and how were they defined?

  RHPs are defined as gene expression programs that exhibit variability across multiple cell lines, identified through non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and hierarchical clustering. They represent common patterns of gene expression that are robustly detected across different contexts.

How do the identified RHPs relate to in vivo programs of heterogeneity in tumors, and what evidence supports this relationship?

  The identified RHPs showed significant overlap with in vivo expression programs from patient tumors, supported by high correlation of signature genes and cell scores between in vitro and in vivo datasets, indicating their relevance to tumor heterogeneity.
